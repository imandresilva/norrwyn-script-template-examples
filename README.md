# Script Template Examples | Sylvan Glade Studio

A set of script templates to use when creating scripts in Unity.
Replaces the default script template with an empty one (removes Start and Update, and unused imports).

## Install
- Paste the ScriptTemplates folder into your Unity Assets directory.
- Restart Unity.
- Right click on any of your project folders.
- Verify if under the Create menu there is a Scripts submenu, which should have all the script templates inside.
